**Bias in Artificial Intelligence**

Through the developments in artificial intelligence, some of us have started to assume that these tehcnological developments are independent from human mind. That's why, regarding collecting and processing data, people expect perfection and full accuracy from these new technologies and improvements.

Nevertheless, this approach is invalid as human effects on artificial intelligence is highly significant. Actually, articial intelligence reflects the knowledge and bias of its producers. Therefore, in order to get the most accurate data and output, developers should use distinctive sort of data that is reliable. This method tends to decrease the level of bias. 

As a social scientist, this topic impressed me to some extent. To illusrate, if artificial intelligence is affected by its producers or developers, this means that cultural and psychological backgrounds of the developers are more important than it was assumed. Also, some bias can be related to these mentioned backgrounds. Even economic and political conditions that developers live in can be a reason for the some sort of the bias. 

How do the cultural patterns of society developers live in affect the articificial intelligence? Does AI include cultural bias? If yes, does AI technology differ from society to society or country to country? Or to what extent? These sort of questions will be more pervasive among social scientists in the near future.
